<h2>A TENTAÇÃO DO MAR</h2>


<p>Ponho-me ás vezes a escutar, atento,<br>
A voz do sangue, a voz da minha raça...<br>
E em meus olhos, então, saudosos, passa<br>
Uma visão que é um deslumbramento!</p>


<p>Em horas de amargura e de anciedade,<br>
Quando os meus braços tombam de fadiga,<br>
&mdash;Ponho-me a ouvir aquela voz antiga<br>
Religiosamente, com saudade...</p>


<p>É quando a noite cai silenciosa<br>
E uma tristeza oculta chora em nós,<br>
Que eu oiço aquela voz misteriosa<br>
E me esqueço a falar com meus avós!</p>


<p>É quando alguem me diz que tudo é morto,<br>
Que a Patria é morta e destruido o lar...<br>
Quando vagueio palido e absorto,<br>
Com amargura, e sem acreditar!</p>


<p>É quando eu vejo a terra abandonada,<br>
O Passado esquecido... E escuto, além,<br>
Na escuridão da noite envergonhada,<br>
Insultarem a Patria, a propria Mãe...</p>


<p>Quando oiço o Mar ao longe, embravecido,<br>
Bolsando ao ar os negros vagalhões,<br>
No silencio profundo e estarrecido,<br>
A cantar as estrofes de Camões...</p>


<p>É quando, á luz amiga das estrelas,<br>
O Mar saudoso e bom, o Mar profundo,<br>
Julga, a sonhar, que embala caravelas<br>
Que vam partir a devassar o Mundo!</p>


<p>Ficam-se os olhos humidos, inquietos<br>
A interrogar em vão a noite escura...<br>
E eu sinto em mim a tragica amargura<br>
Dos destinos falhados, incompletos...</p>


<p>Mas, numa aurora esplendida e bemdita<br>
É então, é então que em mim desperta<br>
E no meu sangue novo ressuscita<br>
O espirito da raça numa alérta!</p>


<p>E no meu sangue, em turbilhões, a ardêr,<br>
Em orgulho e em fé e esforço altivo,<br>
Todas as glorias do Passado vivo,<br>
Todo o passado canta no meu sêr!...</p>


<p>... Sam primeiro os indómitos pastores,<br>
Rudes, selvagens, livres, vagabundos,<br>
Gigantescos, erguidos nos pendores<br>
Das altas serras sob os ceus profundos!...</p>


<p>Vejo-os além de mim, longe, na bruma,<br>
Pelas encostas barbaras da serra...<br>
E olham receiosos a nevada espuma<br>
Dos abraços do Mar cingindo a Terra...</p>


<p>Vejo-os cavando o solo... E o trigo cresce...<br>
&mdash;Olha as searas de oiro, os fructos loiros!...<br>
As enxadas ao Sol,&mdash;olhai,&mdash;parece<br>
Que scintilam no ar como tesoiros...</p>


<p>Vejo-os porfim á beira-Mar, um dia,<br>
Ouvindo as ondas cérulas cantar...<br>
E já os tenta uma visão que erguia<br>
Aos olhos deles a canção do Mar...</p>


<p>Vam-se á floresta... Brilham os machados...<br>
E os troncos descem, mortos, sobre os rios...<br>
Ei-los, na foz que se erguem, espantados,<br>
Ei-los no ar, sam mastros de navios...</p>


<p>Depois,&mdash;ó dia grande!&mdash;eu vejo o Povo<br>
da minha Terra á beira-mar chorando...<br>
É o doirado romper dum tempo novo!<br>
Sam as velas, ao longe, navegando!...</p>


<p>Pelo mar-fóra vão, pela aventura,<br>
Levam sómente a graça do Senhor!<br>
De azas abertas, pela noite escura,<br>
Nem as detém o proprio Adamastor...</p>


<p>Vêde os mareantes, vêde os vagabundos,<br>
Percorrendo as longinquas solidões...<br>
Dam ao mundo espantado novos mundos!..<br>
Dam ao Futuro os versos de Camões!</p>


<p>Abrem a Edade-nova! E o mundo inteiro<br>
Viu-se maior, mais rico ao despertar,<br>
Pelo esforço do Povo-marinheiro<br>
Que atravessára e dominára o Mar...</p>


<p>Grita em meu sangue a fúlgida epopeia,<br>
Céga-me a luz a arder de tantos sois,<br>
Sóbe do Mar da Gloria a maré cheia,<br>
O Sol aureóla as frontes dos herois!</p>


<p>E entam em mim renasce o velho culto,<br>
O antigo amor, a vida vencedora...<br>
E em meus olhos ardentes passa o vulto<br>
Duma Patria a sorrir como uma aurora.</p>


<p>Pulsa irrequieto, a arder, meu sangue novo.<br>
Rasga-se ao meu olhar um alto fim!...<br>
E toda a alma heroica deste povo<br>
Sinto-a sonhar e delirar em mim...</p>


<p>Ah! como é bela a Vida anciosa, inquieta,<br>
Ah! como é grande e belo navegar!<br>
&mdash;Sou marinheiro porque sou Poeta,<br>
&mdash;Vinde comigo, vamos para o Mar!</p>


<p>Ah! como é bela a ancia desmedida<br>
Que nos dilata o peito, a estremecer,<br>
E nos exalta e nos dilata a vida,<br>
E nos levanta e diviniza o ser!</p>


<p>Ó meus avós&mdash;herois da Descobérta,<br>
Quero ir convosco pelos mares fóra...<br>
É a vossa alma que hoje em mim desperta<br>
É o vosso coração que eu sinto agora!</p>


<p>Vamos todos p'ra o Mar!... Se acaso o Mundo<br>
Estreito fôr p'ra tanta anciedade,<br>
Vamos ás Indias que ha no céu profundo,<br>
Vamos cruzar, correr a Imensidade!...</p>


<p>Numa divina ancia erguei os braços,<br>
Livre já das algemas, para o Céu!<br>
&mdash;Ha muitos soes brilhando nos espaços,&mdash;<br>
Vamos roubá-los como Prometeu!...</p>


<p>Ha mundos novos pra arrancar á Treva,<br>
Muitas venturas p'ra roubar á Dôr...<br>
&mdash;Partamos todos numa ardente léva,<br>
Erguendo ao alto pavilhões de Amôr!</p>


<p>No mar profundo e vasto do Futuro<br>
Ha muitas Indias para descobrir...<br>
Vamos abrir á luz o Oceano escuro,<br>
Vamos tocar ás praias do Porvir!...</p>


<p>É embarcar e partir, com anciedade!<br>
&mdash;Vamos buscar aos horisontes nóvos,<br>
Indias-nóvas de Amor e liberdade,<br>
E mais luz e justiça para os Póvos!...</p>


<p>É olhar o Passado!&mdash;Olhai-o vós<br>
Com bons olhos de Amôr... E escutai!<br>
&mdash;E toda a Historia que se escuta em nós,<br>
&mdash;Vêde a maré de gloria que ahi vai!</p>


<p>Deitai barcos ao Mar! Eh!&mdash;marinheiros!<br>
Que esperais vós, entam?&mdash;Vá, embarcar!...<br>
&mdash;Nós somos inda os mesmos marinheiros,<br>
&mdash;É este ainda o mesmo antigo Mar!</p>


<p>O mundo é sempre novo,&mdash;ó meus amigos!<br>
E o Futuro é imenso e o Ideal...</p>

<p>&mdash;Embarquemos p'ra o Mar como os antigos,</p>

<p>&mdash;Que este é ainda o mesmo Portugal!</p>

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
